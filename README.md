**Insights into Crime: A Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Crime in Los Angeles**


**I. Abstract**

This research was initially intended to investigate the location and time of crimes and predict crimes based on crime data in Los Angeles, in the past three years, provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. However, due to limited numerical variables, we were unable to conduct the data analysis we initially hoped to conduct, which involved implementing some sort of regression, so we were unable to make any solid conclusions based on the location and times of crimes. Instead, we shifted our study to investigate and identify the possible factors and patterns of crimes to bring to light information to help the public stay safe and avoid crimes in Los Angeles. We explored questions concerning the overall trend of crime, demographics of victims, times of crimes, and the length for a crime to be reported. We cleaned and explored the dataset on RStudio, and utilized multivariable plots, bootstrapping methods, hypothesis testing, and random forests to discover patterns and trends that could help answer our questions. From our study, we concluded that the overall trend of crime in LA in the past 3 years has increased, crimes were more likely to occur in the later half of the day rather than in the first half of the day, and it took about 10 days for a crime to be reported. We also found out that certain areas in LA have more crimes than others, more specifically towards northern/downtown LA. Finally, we identified that the demographics of individuals most likely to be a victim of crime were around 39 years of age, male, or of Hispanic descent.

**II. Introduction**

The following are questions that are going to be explored in this report:

1\. How has crime changed throughout the past three years in Los Angeles?

2\. Where are crimes most likely to occur in Los Angeles?

3\. What demographics are most likely to be a victim of crime in Los Angeles?

4\. When are crimes more likely to occur in Los Angeles?

5\. How long does it take victims to report crimes after they have occurred in Los Angeles?

Our general motivation for looking into LA crime data was to find relationships and patterns that help bring more awareness and safety to the people of LA, by providing them with information that can help them avoid crime. We investigated demographics of victims such as age, sex, and descent, to see who was most likely to be a victim of a crime. We also looked into the times crimes would occur to determine whether crimes occur more during the day or at night, so we could inform individuals to be more aware during these times. The average length it took for a crime to be reported was also looked into to find out if crimes were reported in a timely manner because decreasing the number of days would inform the population of a crime quicker and increase awareness. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), a reputable and transparent public organization. It encompasses crime records in the city of Los Angeles from the year 2020 to the present date (last updated on October 18, 2023). The crime records are transcribed from original crime reports that were on paper first. The dataset is updated on a weekly basis, ensuring the inclusion of the latest information. While the LAPD is considered a trustworthy source, it is essential to acknowledge that there may be inaccuracies in the data. The dataset covers crimes reported in the city of Los Angeles, offering insights into various criminal activities over the specified time frame. Addresses are maintained to the nearest hundred block to preserve privacy, and in cases wherethe address is unavailable, the default coordinates are set to (0º, 0º).

**III. Data Description**

The dataset comprises 815,882 crime records and 28 variables, with “dr\_no.” Key features we

noticed at first were crime codes (Crm Cd) ranging from 110 to 956 and detailed geographic

information such as ‘location’, ‘area’ and ‘area\_name.’ We found these variables useful for our

initial question on investigating and predicting where crime will occur in Los Angeles. This

dataset was more appropriate to answer our finalized set of study questions because it had

various categorical variables on victim demographics that will help us identify individuals most

likely to be victims of crime and time records to help determine a time period most crimes would

occur. Variables such as the date and time of crime occurrences are captured in 'date\_rptd',

'date\_occ', and 'time\_occ', while victim demographics were reflected in 'vict\_age', 'vict\_sex', and

'vict\_descent.'

To prepare the dataset for exploration and analysis, we took note of missing values for each

variable. Most columns didn’t have missing data except for “weapon\_used\_cd”, “premis\_cd”,

“crm\_cd\_1”, “crm\_cd\_2”, “crm\_cd\_3”, “crm\_cd\_4” with the most being ~99.9% missing

values. When we removed rows with at least one missing value, we saw an extremely significant

reduction with only about 6.946145e-03% of the original data remaining. It was also important to

note that unknown sexes in “vict\_sex” were indicated with “X” instead of being left blank.

Unknown descents in “vict\_descent” were also indicated with “X.” “vict\_sex” also included

unrelated values such as “-”, “ “, “H” that were not explained, so rows without these values were

taken out of the data set and put into a new dataframe, “clean\_crime”, for better data

visualization on victim sexes.

**IV. Data Exploration:**

**Most committed crimes**

We start off the data exploration by seeing what crimes are the most common and what percent

of the total crimes are these most committed crimes. We obtain the following list of most

committed crimes and its criminal code with the most prevalent being stolen Vehicles with

around 10.71% of all crimes being that crime.

**Most used weapons in crimes where weapon was used**

Next we see what weapons are the most common in crimes where a weapon was used and what

percent of the total crimes are these weapons used in. We obtain the following list of most most

used weapons in crimes where the weapon was used and its weapon code with the most used

weapon being a “STRONG-ARM” with around 18.681% of crimes using that as a weapon.

**Crimes by time**

Next, part of the data exploration we attempt to explore the time occurrence of crimes variable in

the dataset. We plot the variable into a histogram and split the bin widths to a value of a 100 to

make each bin represent a single hour of the day as the time is provided in a 3 - 4 digit value

representing military time.

In the graph, we can see that crimes are following this cyclical pattern where starting at 5 am and

every hour till 6 pm the number of crimes gradually increase in the time period and then from 6

pm till 5 am the number of crimes seem to drop in the time period and this cycle seems to repeat

itself. However, there seems to be an anomaly in the distribution of time of crime occurrence

where there is a rather large spike in crimes and seems to be the peak of the distribution. The

earliest crime happens at 00:01 in the morning and latest at 23:59 in the night with the median

timing being at 13:23 in the afternoon.

**Understanding Ages of victims**

Next, part of the data exploration to answer our question about the demographics of victims we

must understand the age of our victims. We also use a histogram for this variable so we can see

the distribution of the age of victims in our data where the x-axis is the age of the victims and

y-axis is counted in each bin where binwidth is equal to 10. We also use a box-plot to better

visualize the outliers of the distribution.

Standard Deviation: 15.586

Looking at the graph we can see that the distribution of victim ages are slightly skewed to the

right. Victims beyond age 83 are considered outliers with about 3703 observations of victims

beyond age 83 but taking into account for the dataset it is insignificant that is seen in the box

plot. The median age of victims is about 37 years old and mean age is 39.58, and also we can see

in histogram that the age range that has a peak and with the most victims of crimes is in the

30-39 years age range. The youngest victim is about 2 years old while the oldest is 120 years old.

The ages of victims typically deviate from the mean by 15.586 years.

**Understanding role of victim descent:**

Next, part of the data exploration to answer our question about the demographics of victims we

must also understand the descent of victims to get a better picture. We also use a bar graph for

this variable so we can see the distribution of the descent of victims in our data where the x-axis

is the descent of the victims and y-axis is a count in each group.

Descent Code: A - Other Asian B - Black C - Chinese D - Cambodian F - Filipino G -

Guamanian H - Hispanic/Latin/Mexican I - American Indian/Alaskan Native J - Japanese K -

Korean L - Laotian O - Other P - Pacific Islander S - Samoan U - Hawaiian V - Vietnamese W -

White X - Unknown Z - Asian Indian

Summary Statistics:



<a name="br7"></a>

Looking at the graph we can see that Hispanics have the largest number of victims by a large

margin with about 246,231 victims, then next coming White Americans with about 154,481

victims, and third is African Americans with about 114,994 victims.

**Understanding the role of sex and crimes:**

Sex code: F - Female M - Male X - Unknown

Looking at the graph we can see that men seem to have a larger count of crimes compared to

women and the unknown, with the counts of unknown sex (7389) being significantly lower than

the males (309967) and females (297221).

**Understanding the days to report crimes:**

Next, part of the data exploration to answer our question about how long it takes victims to

report their crime. We first of all have to calculate the days to report by finding the difference in

days from the day the crime was reported and the day the crime occurred. Then we plot the

calculated days on histogram to see the distribution of the day it takes for victims to report their

crimes.

SD 56.85481

Looking at the graph we can see that the distribution of days to report the crimes are heavily

skewed to the right with a peak at 0. We can see that most crimes are reported on the same day of

the crime, while the median number of days it takes to report is 1 day and the mean is 10.49

days. Quickest report time is 0 days with 25th percentile also being 0 days and slowest report

time has been 1370 days later(3 years and 8 months). The IQR for this distribution is 2 days and

the days to report a crime typically deviates from the mean by 56.85 days.

**Understanding Crimes by Areas:**

Next, part of the data exploration we attempt to answer our question about where crimes are

mostly likely to occur in Los Angeles using the dataset. We first of all summarize a list of the top

10 areas with the most crimes with the corresponding number of crimes that have been recorded

in that area and what percentage of crimes happen in that area. We find that “Central” area has

the most number of crimes reported with about 7.06% of all crimes in LA happening in that area,

the “77th Street” area is second with 6.40% of all crimes in LA happening in that area, and lastly

the “Southwest” area is third with 6.29% of all crimes in LA happening in that area.

**Continued crimes by Areas: (**Extra Credit Visualization - Using more than two variables)

We continued our exploration of the areas to answer the same question and create the following

scatterplot below using the “Latitude” as the x-coordinate, “Longitude” as the y-coordinate, and

“Area” of the crimes as the color for the point. The points are made smaller and semi transparent

to help visualize density of crimes in areas. We observe that parts of Los Angeles that are more

towards the north towards downtown parts of LA in the graph are rather more dense with crime

and as you go towards the south-eastern areas of Los Angeles we see that the density of crimes is

lesser.

**Understanding Crime over the past 3 years:**

Next, part of the data exploration to answer our question about how crime has changed over the

past 3 years in LA. We also use a bar graph for this variable so we can visualize the number of

crimes in each year where the x-axis is the year and y-axis is a count in each group. We observe

that in the bar plots each year the number of crimes in Los Angeles have been increasing with a



<a name="br10"></a>

slight increase from 151,104 crimes in the year 2020 to 158,853 in 2021 crimes to a rather larger

jump to 178,250 in the year 2022.

**Further Explorations on Variables in Subgroups**

\-

\-

Variables may not independently account for the rate of crimes, there also may be

correlational patterns between variables that together accounts for the rate of crimes, so

we want to divide our data into subgroups by victim’s sex, age interval, and crime

occuring time of day and investigate the frequency of crime of different crime types,

weapon types, case statuses, locations and areas, with respect to each subgroups.

For age interval we divide age groups to: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-65,65+;

For day of time we divide time of a day to 0-6,6-12,12-18,18-24

**Analysis**

As we can see, in comparison to the general distribution, among all 4 variables we explore:

\-

Victims from ages 30 to 50 have significantly larger frequency of crimes regardless of the

crime apart from Battery and Burglary where there is a spike of victims for crimes in the

age groups of 50 year to 65 year olds.

\-

\-

Across victims regardless of age we see the same distribution as the frequency of most

weapons used.

100 Grove Drive seems to have a large disproportionate amount of crime victims in the

30-40 age range, while crime on 7th seems to disproportionately affect victims age 50 -

65, and crime on 5th seems to be pretty equally distributed for victims ages 30-65, while

the remaining locations seem to follow the same general shape as the overall distribution

follows.

\-

We observe for the areas in LA, they seem to follow the same distribution of crimes

regardless of age.

Note: Locations have the most different pattern from general pattern, it might give us more

information towards victim age.

**Analysis**

We do acknowledge that there are many different sexes however, the number of observations in

our dataset for other sex are very minimal and we are using only the three above as they have

large enough observations to where we can drive insights to our dataset.

As we can see, in comparison to the general distribution, among all 4 variables we explore:

\-

\-

Unknown sex has least recorded crimes in all subgroups, apart from locations

Males exhibit a relatively higher count of crimes in most of the crime types apart from

Intimate Partner Assault and Identity Theft.

\-

\-

For all the weapons men have higher counts of crime apart from verbal threats, where

women were more likely to use them as a weapon

Across areas “77th street” has lot more counts for females victims than men and same

goes for “Southeast” and “Southwest,” while the remaining areas either have similar

counts or men are higher

\-

Across locations, surprising we can see that locations like “100 The Grove Dr” and

“10200 Santa Monica Blvd” the Unknown sex seems to have the highest frequency

Note: Weapon Types has the most different pattern from general pattern, it might give us more

information towards victim sex,

Unknown firearm, and semi-auto pistol (Weapon type)

18:00 - 23:59 exhibits relatively higher frequency of crimes in Handgun, Unknown

firearm, and semi-auto pistol (Weapon type); NA - Unknown Crime (Crime type);6th, 6th

Street, 7th, 7th Street, Figueros Street, and Hollywood (Location), Central (Area)



<a name="br16"></a>

Note: We can observe that crime with firearms and certain streets has a relationship between day

(6:00 - 18:00) and night (18:00 - 6:00).

**Crime Over past 3 years:**

To answer our research question about how crimes have changed over the past 3 years we take a

look at the most common crimes in LA and see how they have changed over the past few years

using faceted bar plots. We can clearly see that crime from 2020 to 2022 has increased

dramatically in 2 main categories which includes Identity theft and Motor Theft over $950.

Crime has also significantly increased in the “Central” and “Olympic” neighborhoods” of LA

over the past 3 years.

**V. Data Analysis Methods:**

**1. How has crime changed throughout the past three years?**

First, we look at the number of crimes for the past three years on a bar graph to visualize the

counts of crimes each year and see how it’s changed over the past few years. Then, we further go

down into our subgroups and look at bar plots that are faceted by different crime types and areas,

and case statuses to see how crime has changed over those variables.

**2. Where are crimes most likely to occur in Los Angeles?**

First, we break down each area and area code with their total count of crimes and the proportion

of crime in LA that has occurred in that area. Then we assembled a type of density map using the

latitude and longitude of each crime on a scatter plot to model a map and used the areas of each

crime to color code the map and help visualize the crime areas that have the most and least

crime.

**3. What demographics are most likely to be a victim of crime?**



<a name="br17"></a> 

16

We focused on 3 main demographics for those most likely to become victims of crime:

1\. Age

2\. Race

3\. Sex

For our age, we conduct a bootstrap sampling distribution from our dataset where we calculate a

confidence interval of the mean victim ages by conducting random samples with replacement of

the victim ages and then calculate a mean and repeat it 1,000 times to estimate our true mean age

of victims in LA.

For each race, we only look at the top 3 observed races that include Hispanic, African American,

and White as those races have the largest amounts of observations in the data set. We conduct

two different statistical tests to see what races truly have more or less victims. The first statistical

test we conduct is difference in proportions tests to see whether or not there is a difference in

proportions in crime victims that are African American or White by constructing a bootstrap

sampling distribution by conducting random samples with replacement, collecting the difference

in proportion in crimes, and then repeating it a 1000 times. We also calculate the confidence

interval to determine which race has more proportion of victims. The second test is almost the

same with the races in the test being White and Hispanic instead.

For sex, we conduct a difference in proportions test to see whether or not there is a difference in

proportions in crime victims that are female or male by constructing a bootstrap sampling

distribution by conducting random samples with replacement and collecting the difference in

proportions of crimes for each of the sexes and repeating it a 1000 times and using the

confidence interval to determine which sex has more proportion of victims.

We also construct a random forest model that classifies the sex of a victim using the other

variable in the dataset and we are able to obtain a variable importance plot to see what variables

seem to affect sex of the victims. (i.e what are the differences in circumstances between sexes for

crime victims).

**4. When are crimes more likely to occur in LA?**

We conduct a statistical test to determine whether or not there is a difference in proportion of

crimes that happen in the first part of the day or the second part of the day using a bootstrap

sampling distribution by conducting random samples with replacement and collecting the

proportion of crimes that happen in part of the day and repeating it a 1000 times.

**5. How long does it take victims to report crimes?**



<a name="br18"></a> 

17

We construct a confidence interval for the true mean number of days it takes victims to report

using a bootstrap sampling distribution by conducting random samples with replacement and

collecting the proportion of crimes that happen in part of the day and repeating it a 1000 times.

**6. Based on other data, can we make predictions on victims’ sex?**

In real life scenarios, if there is some missing information in some crime cases, are there any

ways we can predict based on our given information to help case solving? One of the most direct

and used information can be victim sex. Based on other information, we want to construct a

random model to

**VI. Results:**

**1. How has crime changed throughout the past three years?**

Crime over the past 3 years has increased every year from 2020 to 2022 with reported crimes

increasing all the from 151, 104 crimes to 178, 250 crimes which is an 18% increase in crime

from 2020 to 2022. Specific crimes such as Identity Theft have increased by 149.55% from

2020 to 2022 and Motor Theft of Vehicles over $950 has increased by over 113.51%. Crimes

have also increased in certain specific areas such as “Central” where crime has jumped 59.66%

from 2020 to 2022 and “Olympic” where crime has jumped 29.74% from 2020 to 2022.

**2. Where are crimes most likely to occur in Los Angeles?**

In the table, we are able to see that areas that have the most crimes are Central and 77th Street

with 7.06% and 6.40% of the crimes happening there. When we look at the density map below

we can see that these areas and their surrounding areas are specifically dense in the map

depicting the higher levels of crime in the map. We are able to see roughly the shape of the city

of LA with gaps depicting areas not part of the city of LA or low crimes/low populated areas.

Areas of Los Angeles that are more towards the north towards downtown parts of LA that



<a name="br19"></a> 

18

include the “Central” and “77th Street” areas are rather more dense with crime (i.e dangerous)

and as you go towards the south-eastern areas of Los Angeles we see that the density of crimes is

lesser and likely more safer.

**3. What demographics are most likely to be a victim of crime?**

Confidence interval: What is the true average age of a crime victim in Los Angeles?

**1) Bootstrapping of mean age from crime data**

**2) Conclude confidence interval**



<a name="br20"></a> 

19

Using a 95% confidence interval we obtain the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the

distribution and obtain the confidence interval of (39.53891, 39.61744).

We can say that we are 95% confident that the mean age of a crime victim in LA is between

39\.53891 and 39.61744.

Hypothesis test: is there evidence that male/females are more vulnerable to crimes?

*From our crime data we observe a 0.57 (around 6%) difference in proportion, the difference*

*does seem large. However, does this really implies irrelevance in the context of around 800,000*

*samples?*

**1) Test Construction**

We set our hypotheses as the following with the significance level: alpha = 0.05.

H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>male</sub> - p<sub>female</sub> = 0 (Probability of being victim is the same between male/female)

H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>male</sub> - p<sub>female</sub> ≠ 0 (Probability of being victim is different between male/female)

<b>2) Distribution Bootstrapping with H<sub>0</sub></b>

Based on our H<sub>0</sub> assumption, we construct sample of 50% male - 50% female victim

sample and bootstrap it for 1000 times and obtain the following distribution plot:

**3) Distribution analysis:**

To our surprise, for a sample of this size, if we assume a 50% - 50% probability,

the distribution of proportion difference is almost 100% within 0.01, much smaller than

proportion difference 0.57 in our data, which means our p-value is 0 < 0.05, H<sub>0</sub> gets

rejected so there is indeed a difference between the probability of male and female being

victim.



<a name="br21"></a> 

20

Hypothesis test: whether crimes are targeted(biased) towards between two races with a 5%

significance level

*White/Black/Hispanic descent victims Hypothesis testing: Is there evidence that points to*

*whether white, black, or hispanic descents (top three descents in “vict\_descent”) were*

*more subjected to crimes?*

**1) Test Construction**

H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>white</sub>- p<sub>black</sub> = 0 (the proportion of white and black victims are the same)

H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>white</sub>- p<sub>black</sub> ≠ 0 (the proportion of white and black victims are not the same)

**2) Distribution Bootstrapping**

Next, a bootstrap of the differences between the proportion of white descent victims and black

descent victims was simulated, and resulted in the sampling distribution below.

**3) Hypothesis test analysis**

All of the values in this distribution are non-zero so we can say that the p-value is 0. So we are

able to reject the null hypothesis and say that we have convincing evidence that the proportion of

white victims and crimes black victims of crime is not the same. Based on a 95% confidence

interval (0.158000, 0.195805), we can conclude with 95% confidence that the true difference in

proportions will never be 0, meaning the proportion of white descent victims and black descent



<a name="br22"></a> 

21

victims cannot be the same. Additionally, the range of sample differences are also all positive,

meaning the proportion of white descent victims is greater than the proportion of black descent

victims.

Next, we compare the difference of proportion between white descent victims and hispanic

descent victims.

**1) Test construction**

H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>white</sub>- p<sub>hispanic</sub> = 0 (the proportion of white and black victims are the same)

H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>white</sub> - p<sub>hispanic</sub> ≠ 0 (the proportion of white and black victims are not the same)

**2) Distribution Bootstrapping**

Next, a bootstrap of the differences between the proportion of white descent victims and hispanic

descent victims was simulated, and resulted in the sampling distribution below.

**3) Hypothesis test analysis**

All of the values in this distribution are non-zero so we can say that the p-value is 0. So we are

able to reject the null hypothesis and say that we have convincing evidence that the proportion of

white victims and crimes hispanic victims of crime is not the same. Based on a 95% confidence

interval (-0.2214 -0.1826), we can conclude with 95% confidence that the true difference in

proportions will never be 0, meaning the proportion of white descent victims and black descent

victims cannot be the same. Additionally, the range of sample differences are also all negative,

meaning the proportion of hispanic descent victims is greater than the proportion of white

descent victims.



<a name="br23"></a> 

22

– Overall analysis on victim descents

Using the two conclusions from the two hypothesis testings above, we concluded that hispanics

were most likely to be victims of crime based on the conclusion that hispanic descent victim

proportions were higher than white descent victimes, which were higher than black descent

victims.

**Random Forest model for victim sex:**

*We want to construct a model to see given other crime information, what is the likely sex of the*

*victim. This sometimes provides clues to solve cases when the victim's information is incomplete*

*and also helps us tell what other variables are associated with a victim’s sex. To achieve our*

*goal, we want to build a random forest model. There is no gender discrimination but we have not*

*yet learned the visualization of multi-class classification so we are only focusing on female/male*

*classification.*

**1) Data Preprocessing**

In our data exploration parts, we have found some variables that may provide information to the

victim's sex: time\_occ, area, crm\_cd\_desc, vict\_age ,weapon\_desc, location, vict\_descent,

statuses. We select these columns as well as vict\_sex. For crime code description, weapon

description, and locations, they have too many types as categorical variables, so we only filter

the top 12 of them. After these steps we are left with a 5000 rows data, we then split them into

training set and testing set

**2) Data Training**

We put our filtered training dataset to train with random forest model, here is a summary of

model and the importance of each variable:

**3) Data Validation**

We validate our model with the test data and generates confusion matrix:

Test Misclassification Rate: 0.30

**4) Reflection**

The misclassification rate of females is much higher than male, maybe because there are too

many male instances than females, and this is also not the case of population. It can lead to bad

results if the predictor predicts more victims male which is not good for the population

prediction. We want to balance the crime\_filtered data. We can see from our datasets there are

more male instances than female.

**5) Revision**

We downsample male instances to balance the instances of both classes such that the number of

instances in both classes are the same. We then repeat our training/validation for the new data to

obtain our new models statistics and confusion matrix:

Test Misclassification Rate: 0.357

**6) Interpretation:**

For the original data set, we have a test misclassification rate of 0.30, which is lower than the

balanced data set, 0.357. However, the balanced data set does have a more balanced

misclassification rate on each class. Since our down-sampling has eliminated about one third of

the total instances,the increase in misclassification rate may be due to the decrease in the size of

our training data set. A misclassification rate of 0.3 ~0.36 is much better than predicting with

mean, but it is still not accurate and reliable enough. Considering the important influence of

training data set size, We can consider adding more instances from years prior to 2017 in Los

Angeles, as well as instances from other large cities to further increase our model’s performance.

We also find out that variables such as the time a crime occurs and the victim's age are the most

influential factors into the victim’s sex.

**4. When are crimes more likely to occur in LA?**

Hypothesis test: Is there a difference in the amount of crimes that happen in the first half of the

day or the second half of the day?

**1) Test construction**

We set our hypotheses as the following with the significance level: alpha = 0.05.

H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>first half</sub> - p<sub>later half</sub> = 0 (Crime is same throughout the day)

H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>first half</sub> - p<sub>later half</sub> ≠ 0 (Crime differs throughout different halves of the day)

**2) Distribution Bootstrapping**

-0.2633 -0.2572 -0.2557 -0.2558 -0.2543 -0.2487

**3) Hypothesis test analysis**

We can see that the min value of the and max value of the distribution are negative so all the

differences are non-zero so we can say that the p-value is 0. Since p-value < 0.05, we are able to

reject the null hypothesis and say that we have convincing evidence that crime differs throughout

the different halves of the day.

Since, the entire interval is negative we are able to conclude that more crimes happen in the later

half of the day.

Confidence interval: What time is a crime most likely to occur?

**1) Bootstrapping**



<a name="br27"></a> 

26

We obtain the following simulated bootstrap distribution for mean.

**2) Confidence interval analysis**

Using a 95% confidence interval we obtain the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the

distribution and obtain the confidence interval of (1321.322, 1324.659).

We can say that we are 95% confident that the mean time a crime occurs is between 13:21.322

and 13:24.659.

**5. What is the true average number of days it takes for a crime to get**

**reported?**

Since only the date reported is recorded (date\_rptd), we were only able to look into the average

days it took for a crime to be reported by taking the difference between the day the crime

occurred (date\_occ) and the day the crime was reported (date\_rptd). A bootstrap sampling

distribution of these differences resulted in the distribution below. Using a 95% confidence



<a name="br28"></a> 

27

interval (10.13930 10.89253), we are 95% confident that the true average days it took for a crime

to be reported took around 10 days.

Hypothesis test: is there evidence that weekend/weekdays have more crimes?

**1) Test construction**

H<sub>0</sub>:, p<sub>weekday</sub> = 5/7,p<sub>weekend</sub> = 2/7 (There is no difference in crimes per day, then weekdays will

consist 5/7 of all crimes, weekend consist 1 - 5/7 = 2/7 since they are mutually exclusive.)

H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>weekday</sub> ≠ 5/7,p<sub>weekend</sub> ≠ 2/7 (There is a difference in crimes per day, then weekdays will not

consist 5/7 of all crimes and consistent;y weekends will not consist 2/7)

Significance Value: alpha = 0.05

**2) Distribution bootstrapping**

**3) Hypothesis testing analysis**

As we can see, there are at least around 0.2-0.3 data more extreme than our statistic, so p-value >

0\.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, so there is no evidence that weekdays or weekends has

more crimes per day

**VIII. Conclusion**

From our study, we are able to conclude that the overall trend of crime in LA in the past 3

years has increased by over 18%, with more specifically crimes such as Identity Theft & Motor

Theft over $950 increasing over 50%, and crimes in areas such as Central and Olympic

increasing over 25%. Crimes in Los Angeles are more likely to occur in the later part of the day

rather than at night with the average time a crime happens being at around 13:21.32 and

13:24.66, and found that it would take about 10 days on average for a crime to be reported. We

also observed that certain parts of Los Angeles are more dangerous than others with crimes being

more in counts and dense towards north and downtown LA, while areas towards south-eastern

Los Angeles are safer with lesser density of crime. We find out that our victims sex’s are mostly

associated by the time a crime occurs and their ages. Finally, we identified that the demographics

of an individual most likely to be a victim of crime was a victim that is around the age between

39\.53 years old and 39.62 years old, male, and of Hispanic descent. Due to the lack of numerical

variables that were of significance, we were unable to implement many other types of graphs

such as scatter plots, establish any types of correlation between numerical variables in our report,

or implement any sort of regression model in our report that could answer the question “Can we

predict the time of a crime in LA based on other variables ?” We only compared the races/sexes

that had a significant number of observations, so our analysis may not be appropriate to

understand crime for these other races/sexes. If we had more data of the general Los Angeles

public and criminal data combined, in the future we would like to create a model that could

predict if a person with specific demographics is likely to become a victim of a crime in their

lifetime and what specific crime is that person most likely to be a victim to.
